        3. Calculate the power of a number
- **Recursion Scenarios Set-2**
        
        1. Find factorial which accepts a number and returns the factorial of that number
        2. Write a function called productOfArray which takes in an array of numbers and returns the product of them all
        3. Write a function called recursiveRange which accepts a number and adds up all the numbers from 0 to the number passed to the function
        4. Write a fibonacci series
- **Recursion Scenarios Set-3**
        
        1. Input a string and returns a new string in reverse
        2. Check if the string passed is a Palindrome
        3. Write a Recursive method which accepts an array and a callback
        4. Flatten array of arrays
